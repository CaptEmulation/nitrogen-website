# cameraCommand

cameraCommand messages relay camera control commands to devices with that capability. 

## Implementation

Services can add schema support for cameraCommand to a service, device, or application by including the module `nitrogen-camera` in the project via npm:

	npm install nitrogen-camera

## Properties

The following properties are used in the body element of a claim message:

* command (string, required): The command that the camera should execute. Should be one of:
    * `snapshot`: One-shot snapshot. Camera should execute snapshot as soon as possible to the timestamp of this command message (which can occur in the future) and send an `image` message with response_to set to this cameraCommand.
    * `motion`: Detect motion until this cameraCommand expires. Camera should start motion detection as close as possible to the timestamp specified and send `image` messages with response_to set to this cameraCommand.

* message (object, optional): An object with attributes that should be applied to image message(s) generated by this command. For instance, a message value of { tags: ['sunset','house'] } would apply these tags to the messages generated.
