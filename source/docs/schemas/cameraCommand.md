# cameraCommand

cameraCommand messages contain a camera control command that the camera referenced in the to: field should execute at the specified timestamp. 

## Implementation

The cameraCommand schema is included in the module `nitrogen-camera`. You can add camera functionality to any service, device, or application by adding this module as a dependency via npm:

`npm install nitrogen-camera`

## Properties

The following properties are used in the body element of a claim message:

* command (string, required): The command that the camera should execute. Should be one of:
    * `snapshot`: One-shot snapshot. Camera should execute snapshot as close as possible, but not before, the timestamp of this command message (which can occur in the future) and send an `image` message with response_to set to this cameraCommand.

* message (object, optional): An object with attributes that should be applied to image message(s) generated by this command. For instance, a message value of { tags: ['sunset','house'] } would apply these tags to the message(s) generated.
